  abstract = {The RuNNE Shared Task approaches the problem of nested named entity recognition. The annotation schema is designed in such a way, that an entity may partially overlap or even be nested into another entity. This way, the named entity "The Yermolova Theatre" of type "organization" houses another entity "Yermolova" of type "person". We adopt the Russian NEREL dataset for the RuNNE Shared Task. NEREL comprises news texts written in the Russian language and collected from the Wikinews portal. The annotation schema includes 29 entity types. The nestedness of named entities in NEREL reaches up to six levels. The RuNNE Shared Task explores two setups. (i) In the general setup all entities occur more or less with the same frequency. (ii) In the few-shot setup the majority of entity types occur often in the training set. However, some of the entity types are have lower frequency, being thus challenging to recognize. In the test set the frequency of all entity types is even. This paper reports on the results of the RuNNE Shared Task. Overall the shared task has received 156 submissions from nine teams. Half of the submissions outperform a straightforward BERT-based baseline in both setups. This paper overviews the shared task setup and discusses the submitted systems, discovering meaning insights for the problem of nested NER. The links to the evaluation platform and the data from the shared task are available in our github repository: https://github.com/dialogue-evaluation/RuNNE.},

  abstract = {The paper studies machine reading comprehension model (MRC) (Li et al., 2020) in its application to extracting nested named entities (nested NER) in the RuNNE-2022 evaluation (Artemova et al., 2022). The model transforms named entity recognition tasks to a question-answering task. In this paper we compare several approaches to formulating ''questions'' for the MRC model such as entity type names (keywords), entity type definitions, most frequent examples for the train set, combinations of definitions and examples. We found that using two most frequent examples from the training set is comparable in quality of nested NER with gathering qualitative definitions from different dictionaries, which is much more complicated. In the RuNNE evaluation, the MRC model obtained the best results among models without any manual work (rules or additional manual annotation of texts).},

We apply the Binder model, which was previously successfully applied to the recognition of nested named entities, to extract nested terms. We obtained the best results of term recognition in all three tracks of the RuTermEval competition. In addition, we study the new task of recognition of nested terms from flat training data annotated with terms without nestedness. We can conclude that several approaches we proposed in this work are viable enough to retrieve nested terms effectively without nested labeling of them.},
